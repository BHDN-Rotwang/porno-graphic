Palette Data
============
Each system has its own format for palette data. Some systems have a fixed
palette, while others allow for a range of colors based on components.

1BPP
====
1BPP palette data is typically black=0 and white=1, but can be changed.

0 = #000000
1 = #111111

2BPP
====
Various systems use 2BPP palettes, each having a different format.
Furthermore, some systems generate their colors instead of having fixed values.

3BPP
====
Only really used on SNES??

4BPP
====
Many variations of 4BPP formats exist.

8BPP
====
This is the standard palette data, using 0-255 per component.

Others
======
There are many nonstandard formats...
We won't be worrying about most of them until much later.

PROMS
=====
Special care should be taken for games where the palette data is stored in a
separate file (or files). We might be able to load the data and use it.
